# breakout_html5

This is one of the earlier games we used in my one-semester JavaScript class.  Again, I hope to rewrite the code and text on this game; reorganizing and updating to Javascript ES2018. We built this game collaboratively.

Recently, my students built this game on the Codepen platform. Here's the link: https://codepen.io/dwbento/pen/eYYjjYe Here, you can see the code that was used during that semester project.

I am currently rewriting the code to be more Object-Oriented. Once the code is finished, I will write some text that guides you and your students through the creation of this game.

Enjoy!!
